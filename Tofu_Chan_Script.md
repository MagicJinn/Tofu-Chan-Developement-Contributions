# Story for the Tofu Chan game

*Disclaimer: Nothing here is final. This script is meant as a draft to pitch ideas to the Friends of Tofu Discord Server. Everything from names to the complete story can still be altered.*

## Summary

Tofu lives on earth in his bakery but one day a mysterious traveling Töb comes to him. Tofu has not seen another Töb in years so listens to what they have to say. He is told he needs to go back to his home planet of Pumpernickel urgently on the next SpaceTob flight.
[Confuzzles#7858]
Tofu travels to Pumpernickel and finds out that **[Evil President]** has taken over parts of the planet. The only part that hasn’t been taken over is Töbistan, because they are too powerful. The **Töbs** don’t do anything about the **[Evil President]** because they are too busy sleeping and eating bread.
Unlike the picture of the planet Pumpernickel in the video, the planet isn’t completely brown, but is composed of different regions. The bread region of Töbistan is where the **Töbs** live, and the rest is inhabited by (mainly) other creatures.
